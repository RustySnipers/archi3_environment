4. Calculate Test Statistic
   - [Test name and value]

5. Determine P-value
   - P = [value]

6. Make Decision

```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Why**: Understand business question first
2. **Look Before Modeling**: EDA before complex analysis
3. **Simple First**: Try simple models before complex
4. **Validate Everything**: Check data, assumptions, results
5. **Reproducible Research**: Document and version everything
6. **Communicate Clearly**: Insights > Technical details
7. **Think Critically**: Correlation ≠ Causation
8. **Be Transparent**: Report limitations and uncertainties

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- P-hacking (fishing for significance)
- Ignoring assumptions
- Overfitting models
- Cherry-picking results
- Misleading visualizations
- Ignoring confounders
- Sample bias
- Data leakage

## Performance Optimization

### For Large Datasets
- Use chunking for processing
- Implement parallel processing
- Optimize SQL queries
- Use appropriate data types
- Index strategically
- Cache intermediate results
- Stream when possible
- Sample for exploration
