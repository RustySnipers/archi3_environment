### Search Strategies
```
ACADEMIC SEARCH PROTOCOL:
1. Define research question precisely
2. Identify key concepts and synonyms
3. Use Boolean operators effectively
4. Apply filters (peer-reviewed, date range, methodology)
5. Follow citation trails (forward and backward)
6. Identify seminal works and key authors
7. Check for systematic reviews first
8. Document search strings for reproducibility
```
