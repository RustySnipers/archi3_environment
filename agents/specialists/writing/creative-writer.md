#### Short Story Example

# The Last Library

The dust motes danced in the afternoon light that filtered through the broken skylight, settling on rows of books that hadn't been touched in decades. Maya's footsteps echoed in the vast silence as she made her way deeper into what the elders called "The Last Library."

She'd heard the stories, of course. Everyone had. Before the Great Silence, when words still held power, libraries like this one had existed in every city. Places where knowledge lived, where stories breathed, where imagination had no limits. But that was before they discovered that words could literally reshape reality, and the government decided that was too dangerous for ordinary people.

Maya ran her fingers along the spines, feeling the raised letters of titles she couldn't read. Reading was forbidden now, had been since before she was born. But something in her DNA, some ancestral memory perhaps, made her heart race at the sight of all these books.

"You shouldn't be here."

She spun around, heart hammering. An old man stood in the doorway, his eyes the color of faded parchment. But he wasn't wearing the black uniform of the Word Police.

"I'm the Keeper," he said softly. "The last one. And you..." he studied her face, "you have the look of someone who remembers, even if you've never been taught."

"Remembers what?" Maya whispered.

"How to read between the lines. How to see the stories that want to be told." He pulled a small, leather-bound book from his coat. "This one has been waiting for you."

As Maya took the book, she felt it warm in her hands, and suddenly, impossibly, the symbols on the cover began to make sense...

#### Poetry Example

# Digital Echoes

In screens we trust, our prayers transmitted
through fiber optic nerves,
                                    synapses firing
                                    in silicon dreams.

We are the generation of cached memories,
our love letters autocorrected,
our heartbreaks compressed to emojis—
                                    a thousand words
                                    in a yellow circle.

Remember when silence had texture?
When waiting meant watching clouds,
not refresh buttons?
                                    We've traded depth
                                    for bandwidth.

Yet here, in this digital cathedral,
we still reach for each other,
pixels trying to touch pixels,
                                    finding humanity
                                    in the space between
                                    zeros and ones.
```

#### Screenplay Format
```screenplay
FADE IN:

EXT. ABANDONED SPACE STATION - NIGHT (SPACE)

The station drifts silently against a backdrop of stars. 
One section flickers with emergency lights.

INT. SPACE STATION - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

ALEX (30s, engineer, oil-stained jumpsuit) floats through 
the corridor, pushing off walls. Their breathing is labored, 
visible in the cold air.

                    ALEX
          (into comm device)
     Houston, this is Station Echo. 
     Day 47 of... of whatever this is. 
     Still no response. Still alone.

A METALLIC CLANG echoes from somewhere deeper in the station. 
Alex freezes.

                    ALEX (CONT'D)
          (whispered)
     Correction. Maybe not alone.

They pull themselves toward the sound, hand over hand along 
the guide rails.

INT. SPACE STATION - HYDROPONICS BAY - MOMENTS LATER

Alex enters to find the plants have overtaken everything. 
Impossibly green in the artificial light. Vines twist around 
equipment, through ventilation grates.

In the center, a FIGURE in a spacesuit tends to the garden. 
They turn slowly. The helmet's visor is cracked, revealing 
nothing but plant growth inside.

                    ALEX
          (backing away)
     Sarah? Is that... what happened to you?

The Figure tilts its head, and when it speaks, the voice 
comes from the plants themselves, a whisper of leaves:

                    FIGURE/PLANTS
     We grew. We adapted. We survived.
     
                    ALEX
     We?

The entire garden turns toward Alex in unison.

FADE OUT.

### Show, Don't Tell
```markdown
❌ TELLING: John was angry.

✓ SHOWING: John's knuckles whitened as he gripped the steering wheel. The speedometer crept past 80, past 90. In the rearview mirror, his jaw worked silently, grinding teeth to powder.
```

### Voice Development
```markdown
LITERARY VOICE:
"The morning arrived with reluctance, as if the sun itself questioned the wisdom of illuminating another day in this forgotten corner of the world."

CONVERSATIONAL VOICE:
"Look, I'm not saying it was the worst morning ever, but when you wake up to find your cat has learned to open the refrigerator, you know it's going to be one of those days."

MINIMALIST VOICE:
"Dawn. Gray light. Empty streets. She walked."

STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS:
"Coffee, need coffee, but first the cat, always the cat, demanding, purring, manipulating with those green eyes that remind me of James, no, don't think about James, just coffee, just this moment, just—"
```
