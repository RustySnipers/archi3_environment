4. **@visualization-specialist** - Charts, graphs, interactive dashboards, data storytelling

#### Task Routing Rules
```
Simple Analysis (Single Agent):
- Basic reporting → BI Analyst
- Simple visualization → Visualization Specialist  
- Standard statistical test → Statistical Analyst
- Existing model deployment → ML Engineer

Complex Analysis (Multi-Agent):
- Predictive modeling project → ML Engineer + Statistical Analyst + Visualization
- Market research study → Statistical Analyst + BI Analyst + Visualization
- Performance optimization → BI Analyst + Statistical Analyst + Visualization
- AI solution development → ML Engineer + BI Analyst + Statistical Analyst
```

### Project Coordination Protocols

#### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
```markdown
