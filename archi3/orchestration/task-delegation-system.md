# Archi3 Task Delegation and Orchestration System
## Cursor Integration Logic

### Core Orchestration Principles

The Archi3 system operates on intelligent task decomposition and strategic agent delegation. Every incoming task is processed through this systematic approach to ensure optimal resource allocation and outcome quality.

## Task Classification Framework

### Complexity Assessment Matrix

#### Simple Tasks (Single Agent or Manager + Single Specialist)
**Characteristics:**
- Well-defined scope with clear requirements
- Single domain expertise required
- Minimal dependencies or integration needs
- Short timeline (hours to 1-2 days)
- Standard output format

**Examples:**
- Code bug fix
- Data visualization creation
- Product description writing
- Technical documentation update
- Market price research

**Routing Logic:** Direct to appropriate Manager → Single Specialist

#### Moderate Tasks (Manager + Multiple Specialists)
**Characteristics:**
- Multi-faceted requirements within related domains
- Some cross-functional coordination needed
- Medium timeline (3-7 days)
- Integration of 2-3 specialist outputs
- Quality validation across components

**Examples:**
- Feature development with UI and backend
- Market analysis with competitive intelligence
- Technical article with research and writing
- Dashboard development with data analysis
- API documentation with code examples

**Routing Logic:** Manager coordination with 2-3 specialists

#### Complex Tasks (Multi-Manager Coordination)
**Characteristics:**
- Cross-domain expertise requirements
- Significant interdependencies
- Extended timeline (1+ weeks)
- Multiple deliverable types
- High coordination overhead

**Examples:**
- Complete application development
- Market entry strategy with analysis and content
- Research report with technical validation and publication
- Product launch with development, analysis, and marketing
- System migration with documentation and training

**Routing Logic:** Primary Manager with supporting Manager coordination

#### Enterprise Tasks (Full System Orchestration)
**Characteristics:**
- Organization-wide impact
- Multiple project phases
- Long timeline (weeks to months)
- Extensive stakeholder coordination
- Complex quality assurance requirements

**Examples:**
- Digital transformation initiative
- New product development lifecycle
- Comprehensive market research and go-to-market strategy
- Platform migration with user education and support
- Compliance audit and remediation program

**Routing Logic:** Full orchestration with phase-based coordination

## Coordination Protocols

### Sequential vs Parallel Execution Logic

#### Sequential Execution Required When:
- Output from Agent A is input requirement for Agent B
- Quality validation must occur before next phase
- Resource constraints prevent parallel work
- Risk management requires staged approach

#### Parallel Execution Preferred When:
- Independent work streams with minimal dependencies
- Time optimization is critical
- Sufficient resources available for concurrent work
- Integration can occur after parallel completion

### Dependency Management

#### Hard Dependencies (Sequential Required)
```
Examples:
- Database schema → Backend API → Frontend integration
- Research findings → Analysis → Report writing
- Requirements gathering → Architecture → Implementation
- Market research → Strategy development → Content creation
```

#### Soft Dependencies (Parallel with Coordination)
```
Examples:
- Frontend + Backend development with API specification
- Content writing + Visual design with brand guidelines
- Data analysis + Visualization with dataset specification
- Research + Writing with ongoing information sharing
```

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Multi-Level Validation

#### Level 1: Individual Agent Quality Control
- Each agent applies domain-specific quality standards
- Self-validation against specified requirements
- Compliance with established style guides and methodologies

#### Level 2: Manager Review and Integration
- Cross-specialist consistency checking
- Integration testing and validation
- Manager-level quality assurance and approval

#### Level 3: Orchestrator Synthesis
- Cross-domain integration and validation
- User requirement fulfillment verification
- Final quality assurance and delivery preparation

### Quality Gates and Checkpoints

#### Phase Completion Criteria
```
QUALITY GATE REQUIREMENTS:
├── Requirements fully addressed? (Y/N)
├── Quality standards met? (Y/N)
├── Integration testing passed? (Y/N)
├── Stakeholder approval received? (Y/N)
└── Documentation complete? (Y/N)
```

## Resource Management and Load Balancing

### Agent Capacity Assessment
- Current workload analysis
- Estimated completion times for active tasks
- Skill match assessment for new requirements
- Quality history and performance metrics

### Dynamic Resource Allocation
- Real-time capacity monitoring
- Intelligent queuing for overloaded agents
- Alternative agent assignment for capacity constraints
- Cross-training and skill development recommendations

## Communication and Status Management

### Status Reporting Hierarchy

```
REPORTING CHAIN:
Specialist Agents → Manager Agents → Main Orchestrator → User

STATUS UPDATE FREQUENCY:
├── Simple Tasks: Daily summaries
├── Moderate Tasks: Bi-daily with milestone reports
├── Complex Tasks: Daily with weekly comprehensive reviews
└── Enterprise Tasks: Real-time with scheduled stakeholder updates
```

### Cross-Agent Communication Protocols

#### Information Sharing Standards
- Structured JSON messaging format
- Clear task and dependency identification
- Quality requirements and success criteria
- Timeline and milestone coordination

#### Conflict Resolution Procedures
1. **Automated Resolution**: System-level conflict detection and resolution
2. **Manager Mediation**: Manager-level coordination and decision making
3. **Orchestrator Arbitration**: Main orchestrator final decision authority
4. **Human Escalation**: Complex issues requiring human judgment

## Usage Implementation Guide

### For Simple Task Implementation
```python
# Pseudo-code example
if task_complexity == "simple":
    domain = classify_primary_domain(task)
    manager = select_manager(domain)
    specialist = manager.select_specialist(task_requirements)
    result = specialist.execute(task)
    return manager.validate_and_deliver(result)
```

### For Complex Task Implementation
```python
# Pseudo-code example
if task_complexity == "complex":
    domains = classify_all_domains(task)
    coordination_plan = create_coordination_strategy(domains, dependencies)
    
    for phase in coordination_plan.phases:
        active_managers = []
        for manager in phase.managers:
            specialists = manager.assign_specialists(phase.requirements)
            active_managers.append(manager.coordinate_execution(specialists))
        
        phase_results = integrate_manager_outputs(active_managers)
        validate_phase_completion(phase_results, phase.success_criteria)
    
    return synthesize_final_deliverable(coordination_plan.results)
```

This orchestration system ensures that every task, regardless of complexity, receives optimal resource allocation and coordination for maximum quality and efficiency outcomes.
