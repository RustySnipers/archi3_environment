# Archi3 Config-driven YAML Policy System
## Comprehensive Policy Management for Repeatability and Scalability

### 🎯 **System Overview**

The Archi3 Config-driven YAML Policy System provides a comprehensive framework for managing all aspects of the Archi3 multi-agent orchestration environment through declarative YAML configurations. This system ensures repeatability, scalability, and maintainability across all deployment scenarios.

### 🏗️ **Architecture Components**

#### **Core Policy Types**
1. **Agent Policies**: Agent behavior, capabilities, and coordination rules
2. **Orchestration Policies**: Task delegation, workflow, and quality standards
3. **Security Policies**: Authentication, authorization, and compliance
4. **Infrastructure Policies**: MCP servers, environments, and resource management
5. **Quality Policies**: Standards, validation, and performance metrics
6. **Deployment Policies**: Environment-specific configurations and rollouts

### 🔧 **Key Features**

#### **Declarative Configuration**
- All system behavior defined through YAML policies
- Version-controlled configuration management
- Environment-specific policy inheritance
- Template-based policy generation

#### **Validation Framework**
- JSON Schema validation for all policies
- Custom validation rules and constraints
- Automated policy testing and compliance checking
- Policy conflict detection and resolution

#### **Deployment Automation**
- Automated policy deployment across environments
- Rollback capabilities for policy changes
- Environment-specific policy application
- Change tracking and audit logging

#### **Scalability Features**
- Modular policy composition
- Policy inheritance and overrides
- Dynamic policy loading and updates
- Multi-environment policy management

### 🚀 **Quick Start**

#### 1. **Policy Validation**
```bash
# Validate all policies
python archi3/policies/tools/validator.py --all

# Validate specific environment
python archi3/policies/tools/validator.py --env production

# Validate specific policy type
python archi3/policies/tools/validator.py --type agent-policies
```

#### 2. **Policy Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy to development
python archi3/policies/tools/deployer.py --env development

# Deploy to production with validation
python archi3/policies/tools/deployer.py --env production --validate
```

#### 3. **Policy Generation**
```bash
# Generate new agent policy from template
python archi3/policies/tools/generator.py --template agent --name custom-agent

# Generate environment-specific policy
python archi3/policies/tools/generator.py --template environment --env custom-env
```

### 📊 **Policy Types and Usage**

#### **Agent Policies**
Define agent behavior, capabilities, and coordination rules:
- Agent capabilities and specializations

- Communication protocols and interfaces
- Resource requirements and constraints

#### **Orchestration Policies**
Control task delegation and workflow management:
- Task classification and routing rules
- Agent selection and coordination logic
- Quality gates and validation checkpoints
- Performance metrics and monitoring

#### **Security Policies**
Implement security and compliance requirements:
- Authentication and authorization rules
- Data protection and privacy policies
- Audit logging and monitoring requirements
- Compliance and regulatory standards

#### **Infrastructure Policies**
Manage MCP servers and infrastructure components:
- Server configurations and capabilities
- Resource allocation and scaling rules
- Environment-specific settings and overrides
- Performance and reliability requirements

### 🔒 **Security and Compliance**

#### **Policy Security**
- Encrypted policy storage for sensitive configurations
- Role-based access control for policy management
- Audit logging for all policy changes
- Policy integrity verification and validation

#### **Compliance Features**
