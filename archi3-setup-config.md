# Archi3 Cursor Setup Configuration
## Installation and Configuration Guide

### Prerequisites

Before implementing Archi3 in your Cursor workspace, ensure you have:

1. **Cursor Editor** installed and updated to latest version
2. **Git repository** initialized for version control
3. **File system permissions** for creating directory structures
4. **Understanding** of your typical project types and complexity levels

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Copy Configuration Files
Place these files in your project root directory:

```
project-root/
├── .cursorrules                           # Main Cursor configuration
├── cursor-system-prompt.md               # Core orchestration prompt
├── archi3/                               # Agent definitions and templates
│   ├── agents/
│   │   └── managers/                     # Manager agent specifications
│   ├── orchestration/
│   │   └── task-delegation-system.md     # Delegation logic
│   └── templates/                        # Project templates
└── archi3-cursor-usage-guide.md          # Usage instructions
```

### Step 2: Verify Configuration
Test the setup with a simple task:

```
USER: "Test the Archi3 system setup"

EXPECTED RESPONSE:
ARCHI3 TASK ANALYSIS:
- Task Type: System Validation
- Complexity Level: Simple
- Required Agents: System validation successful
- Setup Status: [Configuration verification results]
```

### Step 3: Customize for Your Needs
Modify configuration based on your typical projects:

#### For Development-Heavy Teams
```markdown
# Add to .cursorrules
## Development Focus Configuration
- Prioritize @coder-manager for ambiguous tasks
- Default to full-stack development patterns
- Include automated testing requirements
- Emphasize security and performance standards
```

#### For Analytics-Heavy Teams
```markdown
# Add to .cursorrules
## Analytics Focus Configuration
- Prioritize @analyst-manager for data-related tasks
- Default to statistical rigor requirements
- Include data governance and privacy checks
- Emphasize reproducibility and documentation
```

#### For Content-Heavy Teams
```markdown
# Add to .cursorrules
## Content Focus Configuration
- Prioritize @writer-manager for communication tasks
- Default to multi-format content strategies
- Include SEO and accessibility requirements
- Emphasize brand consistency and user experience
```

## Configuration Validation

### System Health Check
Use these prompts to verify system functionality:

```
1. "Analyze this task: Build a simple web form"
   Expected: @coder-manager → @frontend-developer + @backend-developer

2. "Analyze this task: Research competitor pricing strategies"
   Expected: @research-manager → @market-researcher

3. "Analyze this task: Create comprehensive product documentation"
   Expected: @writer-manager → @technical-writer + supporting agents

4. "Analyze this task: Build ML-powered analytics dashboard with full marketing campaign"
   Expected: Multi-manager enterprise coordination
```

### Quality Assurance Verification
```
Test Prompts for Quality Standards:
1. "What quality standards apply to code development?"
2. "How do you ensure statistical rigor in analysis?"
3. "What validation processes exist for research accuracy?"
4. "How is content quality maintained across formats?"
```

## Customization Options

### Agent Specialization Tuning
Modify agent capabilities based on your specific needs:

```markdown
# Example: Enhanced Security Focus
## Add to backend-developer.md
### Security Specialization Enhancement
- OWASP Top 10 compliance mandatory
- Automated security scanning integration
- Threat modeling requirements
- Penetration testing coordination
```

### Quality Standards Adjustment
Customize quality requirements for your organization:

```markdown
# Example: Higher Code Coverage Requirements
## Add to coder-manager.md
### Enhanced Quality Standards
- Code coverage: >95% (increased from >85%)
- Performance: <100ms API response (increased from <200ms)
- Security: Zero critical vulnerabilities (zero tolerance)
```

### Timeline Optimization
Adjust default timeline estimates based on your team velocity:

```markdown
# Example: Faster Development Cycles
## Add to orchestration/task-delegation-system.md
### Timeline Adjustments
- Simple tasks: 0.5-1 day (reduced from 1-2 days)
- Moderate tasks: 2-4 days (reduced from 3-7 days)
- Complex tasks: 1-2 weeks (reduced from 1+ weeks)
```

## Integration with Existing Tools

### Version Control Integration
Configure automatic git integration:

```markdown
# Add to .cursorrules
## Git Integration
- Automatically commit agent outputs
- Tag major milestone completions
- Branch protection for quality gates
- Pull request templates for agent reviews
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Connect with existing automation:

```markdown
